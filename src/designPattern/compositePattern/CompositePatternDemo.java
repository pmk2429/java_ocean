/**
 * Composite pattern is used where we need to treat a group of objects in
 * similar way as a single object. Composite pattern composes objects in term of
 * a tree structure to represent part as well as whole hierarchy. This type of
 * design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern creates a tree
 * structure of group of objects.
 * 
 * This pattern creates a class that contains group of its own objects. This
 * class provides ways to modify its group of same objects.
