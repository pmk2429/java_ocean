/**
 * Count of occurrences of a “1(0+)1” pattern in a string
 * Given an alphanumeric string, find the number of times a pattern 1(0+)1 occurs in the given string.
 * Here, (0+) signifies the presence of non empty sequence of consecutive 0’s.
 * <p>
 * Examples:
 * ---------
 * Input :  010001
 * Output : 3
 * First sequence is in between 0th and 3rd index.
 * Second sequence is in between 3rd and 5th index.
 * Third sequence is in between 5th and 9th index.
 * So total number of sequences comes out to be 3.
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * ---------
 * Input : 1001ab010abc01001
 * Output : 2
 * First sequence is in between 0th and 3rd index.
 * Second valid sequence is in between 13th and 16th
 * index. So total number of sequences comes out to
 * be 2.
