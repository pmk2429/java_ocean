/**
 * Given a schedule containing the arrival and departure time of trains in a station, find the minimum number of
 * platforms needed to avoid delay in any trainâ€™s arrival.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * ----------
 * Trains arrival   = { 2.00, 2.10, 3.00, 3.20, 3.50, 5.00 }
 * Trains departure = { 2.30, 3.40, 3.20, 4.30, 4.00, 5.20 }
 * <p>
 * The minimum platforms needed is 2
 * <p>
 * The train arrived at 2.00 on platform 1
 * The train arrived at 2.10 on platform 2
 * The train departed at 2.30 from platform 1
 * The train arrived at 3.00 on platform 1
 * The train departed at 3.20 from platform 1
 * The train arrived at 3.20 on platform 1
 * The train departed at 3.40 from platform 2
 * The train arrived at 3.50 on platform 2
 * The train departed at 4.00 from platform 2
 * The train departed at 4.30 from platform 1
 * The train arrived at 5.00 on platform 1
 * The train departed at 5.20 from platform 1
