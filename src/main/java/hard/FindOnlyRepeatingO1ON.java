/**
 * Given an array nums containing length + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and length (inclusive), prove that
 * at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * ----------
 * Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
 * Output: 2
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * ----------
 * Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
 * Output: 3
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * -----
 * You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
 * You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
 * Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2).
 * There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

     * <p>
     * First off, we can easily show that the constraints of the problem imply that a cycle must exist.
     * Because each number in nums is between 11 and nn, it will necessarily point to an index that exists.
     * Therefore, the list can be traversed infinitely, which implies that there is a cycle. Additionally,
     * because 00 cannot appear as a value in nums, nums[0] cannot be part of the cycle. Therefore, traversing
     * the array in this manner from nums[0] is equivalent to traversing a cyclic linked list.
