/**
 * Job Sequencing Problem with Deadlines
 * Given a list of tasks with deadlines and total profit earned on completing a task, find the maximum profit earned
 * by executing the tasks within the specified deadlines.
 * Assume that each task takes one unit of time to complete, and a task canâ€™t execute beyond its deadline. Also, only
 * a single task will be executed at a time.
 * <p>
 * For example, consider the following set of tasks with a deadline and the profit associated with it.
 * If we choose tasks 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, we can achieve a maximum profit of 109.
 * Note that task 2 and task 10 are left out.
 * <p>
 * Tasks	Deadlines	   Profit
 * -----------------------------
 * 1            9           15
 * 2            2           2
 * 3            5           18
 * 4            7           1
 * 5            4           25
 * 6            2           20
 * 7            5           8
 * 8            7           10
 * 9            4           12
 * 10           3           5
