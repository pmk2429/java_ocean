/**
 * Example 1:
 * ----------
 * Input: nums = [2,10,7,5,4,1,8,6]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation:
 * The minimum element in the array is nums[5], which is 1.
 * The maximum element in the array is nums[1], which is 10.
 * We can remove both the minimum and maximum by removing 2 elements from the front and 3 elements from the back.
 * This results in 2 + 3 = 5 deletions, which is the minimum number possible.
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * ----------
 * Input: nums = [0,-4,19,1,8,-2,-3,5]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * The minimum element in the array is nums[1], which is -4.
 * The maximum element in the array is nums[2], which is 19.
 * We can remove both the minimum and maximum by removing 3 elements from the front.
 * This results in only 3 deletions, which is the minimum number possible.
 * <p>
 * Example 3:
 * ----------
 * Input: nums = [101]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * There is only one element in the array, which makes it both the minimum and maximum element.
 * We can remove it with 1 deletion.
