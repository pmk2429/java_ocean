/**
 * Write a program to find the common substrings between the two given strings.
 * However, do not include substrings that are contained within longer common substrings.
 * <p>
 * For example, given the input strings "eatsleepnightxyz" and "eatsleepabcxyz", the results should be:
 * <p>
 * eatsleep (due to eatsleepnightxyz eatsleepabcxyz)
 * xyz (due to eatsleepnightxyz eatsleepabcxyz)
 * a (due to eatsleepnightxyz eatsleepabcxyz)
 * t (due to eatsleepnightxyz eatsleepabcxyz)
 * <p>
 * However, the result set should not include e from  eatsleepnightxyz eatsleepabcxyz, because both es are already
 * contained in the eatsleep mentioned above. Nor should you include ea, eat, ats, etc.,
 * as those are also all covered by eatsleep.
 * <p>
 * In this, you don't have to make use of String utility methods like: contains, indexOf, StringTokenizer, split and replace.
